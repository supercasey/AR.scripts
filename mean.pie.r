#' Computation of data necessary to compute mean annual and mean May pie charts for the NAWQA Annual Reporting Mississippi River Section
#'
#' Computes a dataframe to be plotted as a pie chart within the NAWQA Annual Reporting Mississippi River Section
#' @param a.ll is a data frame with all annual loads and flows from all NAWQA National Fixed Site Network locations.  This data frame is requires 6 columns
#' "SITE_QW_ID", which is the USGS station ID for the location used to collect water quality samples; "CONSTIT", which are abbreviations of the various water quality constituents;
#' "MODTYPE", which are abbreviations of types of methods used to compute loads, "WY" which is the water year in which loads are computed or flows were measured;
#' "TONS", which represent the annual water quality load, in tons; and "ANNFLOW_ACREFEET", which is the annual volume of flow, measured in acre-feet
#' @param m.ll is a data frame with all monthly loads and flows from all NAWQA National Fixed Site Network locations.  This data frame is requires 7 columns
#' "SITE_QW_ID", which is the USGS station ID for the location used to collect water quality samples; "CONSTIT", which are abbreviations of the various water quality constituents;
#' "MODTYPE", which are abbreviations of types of methods used to compute loads, "WY" which is the water year in which loads are computed or flows were measured; "MONTH", the month loads are computed;
#' "TONS", which represent the annual water quality load, in tons; and "ANNFLOW_ACREFEET", which is the annual volume of flow, measured in acre-feet
#' @param consts is a vector of characters representing  the parameters to be computed, options (as of 2014) include TN, TP, and NO3_NO2
#' @param wys is a vector of numbers representing the water years desired for one of the mean computations the pie chart, generally this will be 1993 to the current water year (expressed as 1993:2014 presently)
#' @return A dataframe with four columns "Value", which is the value to be plotted in the pie chart; "Constit", the constiuent; "Ptype", which indicates the type of load (WY for WY and May for May in this case); "WY", which indicate the water years over which the mean is computed; and "Basin", the basin being plotted
